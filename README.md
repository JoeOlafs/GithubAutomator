"# GithubAutomator" 

This program simplifies and speeds up process of creating new projects.

This is not my idea nor my code for the most part.
This program from Kalle Hallden and I used it to learn more about programming and command line
In addition I added in the function of creating a 'main' file for the programming language you choose

<b>How it works?</b>

Type into CMD: Project projectName fileEnding

In order for this to work you need to add your personalised Github Token and a directory of your chosing to Environments.
